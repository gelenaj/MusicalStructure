# MusicalStructure
This was the third of nine projects for the Android Basics Nanodegree program through Udacity/Google. The goal of the project was to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView or a GridView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.
Data about each song had to be stored in a custom class that is retrieved and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.

### The required components for this project are:

- 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents
- A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.
- A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.
The appâ€™s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.
